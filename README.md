### Beating Stereotypes
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/programmer.jpg" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> We all know what stereotypes are, and whether we like it or not, we've been stereotyped at some point in our lives.

The programmer stereotype goes something like this: geeky, unsocial, unhygenic neckbeard, math nerd. But let's be serious, that's ridiculous. Programmers come from all different walks of life. And while it's true that the field is male-dominated, things are changing as more and more people of diverse backgrounds get interested in coding. Like [this supermodel](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/20/tech/web/lyndsey-scott-model-coder/), who has two apps in the Apple App Store. Now that's badass.
